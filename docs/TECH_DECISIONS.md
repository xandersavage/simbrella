# Technical Decisions

This document outlines the key technical decisions made during the development of Simbrella Vault and the rationale behind them.

## Architecture

### Monolithic Backend with Microservices Potential

**Decision**: Start with a monolithic backend architecture with clear separation of concerns.

**Rationale**:

- Faster initial development and deployment
- Easier debugging and testing
- Can be split into microservices later if needed, providing scalability
- Reduced operational complexity in early stages

### Frontend Architecture

**Decision**: Use Next.js 14 with App Router for the frontend.

**Rationale**:

- Server-side rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG) capabilities for better performance and SEO
- Simplified routing with the App Router
- Excellent developer experience with TypeScript
- Strong ecosystem and community support
- Built-in optimizations for production

## Technology Choices

### Backend Stack

1. **Node.js with TypeScript**

   - Strong typing for better code quality and maintainability
   - Excellent developer experience and robust tooling
   - Large ecosystem of packages and active community
   - Efficient for building scalable network applications

2. **Prisma ORM**

   - Type-safe database queries, reducing runtime errors
   - Intuitive API for database interactions, enhancing developer productivity
   - Handles database migrations automatically
   - Strong PostgreSQL support, aligning with our database choice

3. **PostgreSQL**
   - ACID compliance, critical for financial transactions, ensuring data integrity
   - Excellent performance and reliability
   - Rich feature set for complex queries and data manipulation
   - Mature and widely adopted relational database

### Frontend Stack

1. **Next.js 15**

   - Modern React framework for building fast and scalable web applications
   - Built-in optimizations for image, font, and script loading
   - Strong TypeScript support for enhanced code quality

2. **Tailwind CSS**

   - Utility-first approach for rapid UI development and highly customizable designs
   - Ensures a consistent design system across the application
   - Results in a small CSS bundle size in production
   - Easy to maintain and extend

3. **Shadcn UI**

   - Provides accessible and customizable UI components, built on Tailwind CSS
   - Integrates seamlessly with Next.js and TypeScript, offering type safety
   - Facilitates rapid development of visually appealing user interfaces

4. **React Query (@tanstack/react-query)**

   - Powerful library for server state management, data fetching, caching, and synchronization
   - Eliminates boilerplate code for loading, error, and data states
   - Offers intelligent caching, automatic re-fetching, and background updates, significantly improving user experience

5. **Zustand**
   - A fast, lightweight, and scalable client-side state management solution
   - Simple API for managing global application state, ideal for authentication status and other non-server-persisted data
   - Minimizes re-renders by only updating components that subscribe to changed state

## Security Decisions

1. **JWT Authentication**

   - Implemented for stateless authentication, enhancing scalability and security
   - Industry-standard approach for token-based authentication
   - Tokens are signed and verified to ensure integrity and authenticity

2. **Password Hashing**

   - User passwords are securely hashed using bcryptjs before storage in the database
   - This prevents direct exposure of passwords even if the database is compromised

3. **CORS Configuration**

   - Properly configured to restrict which origins can access the backend API, preventing unauthorized cross-origin requests

4. **Role-Based Authorization**

   - Middleware for role-based access control, ensuring that users can only access resources and perform actions permitted by their assigned role

5. **Data Persistence Security**
   - Sensitive user and transaction data is stored in PostgreSQL, leveraging its robust security features and transactional integrity

**Note on Rate Limiting & End-to-End Encryption**: While highly desirable for a production financial system, full-fledged API Rate Limiting and comprehensive End-to-End Encryption (beyond TLS for transport and password hashing) were architectural considerations and not fully implemented as part of the core development within this scope. These are planned for future enhancements.

## Infrastructure

1. **Docker**

   - Ensures a consistent development environment across different machines
   - Simplifies deployment by packaging applications and their dependencies into portable containers
   - Facilitates scalability and reproducible builds

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Conceptual: Planning for automated testing and deployment workflows (e.g., using GitHub Actions) to ensure code quality and rapid delivery
   - Aims to integrate quality gates and version control for robust releases

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**

   - Utilizing Jest for backend logic and React Testing Library for frontend components
   - Focus on high coverage for critical paths to ensure individual units function as expected
   - Aims for a fast feedback loop during development

2. **Integration Tests**

   - Testing interactions between different modules, including API endpoint functionality and database integration
   - Covering authentication flows and core transaction processing

3. **End-to-End Tests**
   - Conceptual: Planned to validate critical user journeys from start to finish
   - Would include cross-browser testing, performance testing, and comprehensive security testing

## Future Considerations

1. **Microservices Split**

   - Considered for future architectural evolution as the team grows, scaling needs emerge, and feature complexity increases

2. **Real-time Features**

   - Integration of WebSockets for real-time updates (e.g., live transaction notifications, chat support)

3. **Mobile App**

   - Leveraging React Native for cross-platform mobile development, allowing shared business logic and native performance

4. **Internationalization**
   - Expansion to include multi-currency support, multi-language capabilities, regional compliance, and local payment methods
